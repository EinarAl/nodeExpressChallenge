# nodeExpressChallenge
this was made as a challenge for txt

in order for the code to work properly you have to run npm i express on terminal

there are three pages on the local port, them being /contact /about and /home

/contact gives you a 401 status code

/about is random filler info

/home contains a button that when pressed displays a message
